SQLite lacks\nstored procedures, but has a rich C runtime interface that allows you to create any kind\nof control flow mixed with any SQL operations that you might need.  However, SQLite's programming\ninterface is both verbose and error-prone in that small changes in SQL statements can require\nsignificant swizzling of the C code that calls them. Additionally, many of the SQLite runtime functions have error codes\nwhich must be strictly checked to ensure correct behavior.
